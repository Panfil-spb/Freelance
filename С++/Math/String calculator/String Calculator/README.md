# String calculator
Calculator development. The program should
allow the user to enter a string of characters from the keyboard,
ending with a carriage return (0x0D in
hexadecimal form), then carry out syntactic
parsing the received string, extracting from it such operations as
“sin”, “cos”, “tg”, “ln”, “sqrt” (square root), “^” (construction
to a power), “*”, “/”, “+”, “-”, “(”, “)” and operands (numbers
involved in transactions). 

Further, in accordance with the obtained
expression, the program needs to implement
math operations and display the result.
