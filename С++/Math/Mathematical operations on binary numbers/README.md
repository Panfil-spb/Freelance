# Mathematical operations on binary numbers
A program for performing mathematical operations on binary numbers (integers).
Program requirements:

The program must be object-oriented (a class for binary numbers).

The format for storing binary numbers is an array.

The size of a binary number can be 8 bits (as a constant).

The program must perform operations on binary numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication. The implementation of all operations must be performed "manually" without using the functions for working with the binary representation of numbers. Algorithm logic - "column" calculation operations

Negative numbers are stored in two's complement.

All binary->decimal, decimal->binary translations are implemented independently (bitwise).

The input is two numbers in decimal format and an operation. Output: two original numbers in binary format and the result of the calculation in binary and decimal formats.
Overflows in calculations must be handled (at the time of performing operations on the binary representation).
