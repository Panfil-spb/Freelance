# Sea battle

"Sea battle" is a game for two participants, in which players take turns naming coordinates on an opponent's unknown map. 
If the opponent has a ship at these coordinates (the coordinates are occupied), then the ship or part of it is “sinked”, 
and the one who has fallen gets the right to make one more move.
The goal of the player is to be the first to sink all enemy ships.

## Rules for the placement of ships (fleet)
The playing field is usually a 10x10 square for each player, on which a fleet of ships is placed. Verticals are usually numbered from top to bottom, and horizontals are labeled with letters from left to right. In this case, the letters of the Russian alphabet are used from “a” to “k” (the letters “ё” and “й” are usually omitted) or from “a” to “i” (using the letter “ё”), or the letters of the Latin alphabet from “ a" to "j". Sometimes the word "republic" or "snow maiden" is used, since not a single letter is repeated in these 10-letter words. Since there are various options for setting the coordinate system, it is better to agree on this in advance.

Placed:

    1 ship - a row of 4 cells ("four-deck"; battleship)
    2 ships - a row of 3 cells ("three-deck"; cruisers)
    3 ships - a row of 2 cells ("two-deck"; destroyers)
    4 ships - 1 cell ("single-deck"; torpedo boats)
Another version of the name of the ships: "...-pipe" (for example, two-pipe).

When placed, ships cannot touch each other by sides and corners. There are, however, options when touching the corners is not prohibited. There are also variants of the game when ships can be placed in the letter "G" ("three-" and "four-deck"), square or zigzag ("four-deck"). In addition, there are variants with a different set of ships (e.g. one five-deck, two four-deck, etc.) and / or a different field shape (15x15 for five-deck (aircraft carrier)).

Next to the "own" field, a "foreign" field of the same size is drawn, only empty. This is a section of the sea where enemy ships sail.

When hitting an enemy ship, a cross is placed on a foreign field, and a dot is placed on a blank shot. The victim shoots again.

The most vulnerable are the battleship and torpedo boat: the first due to their large size, and therefore it is relatively easy to find, and the second due to the fact that it sinks in one hit, although it is quite difficult to find it.

## Sinking enemy ships

Before the start of hostilities, players cast lots or agree on who will go first.

The player making the move makes a shot - he calls aloud the coordinates of the cell in which, in his opinion, the enemy ship is located, for example, "B1".

   1. If the shot hit a cell that was not occupied by any enemy ship, then the answer “Miss!” and the shooting player puts a dot on someone else's square in this place. The right to move passes to the opponent.
   2. If the shot hit the cell where the multi-deck ship is located (larger than 1 cell in size), then the answer “Wounded (a)!” or “Hit (a)!”, except for one case (see paragraph 3). The shooting player puts a cross in this cell on a foreign field, and his opponent puts a cross on his field also in this cell. The player who shoots gets the right to one more shot.
   3. If the shot hit the cell where the single-tube ship is located, or the last undamaged cell of the multi-deck ship, then the answer is “Killed (a)!” or “Sunk!” Both players mark the sunken ship on the sheet. The player who shoots gets the right to one more shot.

The winner is the one who first sinks all 10 enemy ships. 
The loser has the right to ask to study the opponent's playing field after the end of the game. 
If the loser finds any violation of the rules (see below), then the victory is awarded to him. 
The original winner, in turn, may ask the opponent for a playing field to look for violations. 
If he finds them, then the players compare other people's fields with each other. 
If no inconsistencies are noticed, then the game is not counted (both lost). 
The one whose opponent's field is incorrect (and provably incorrect) will be the loser, and his opponent will be the winner. 
The game can also end before all ships are sunk if a rule violation is noticed during the game. 
The loser in this case will be considered the one who has found a violation of the rules, although he can also ask the playing field from the opponent to look for violations.
